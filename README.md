# Get Release & Asset

<!-- DESCRIPTION -->

## Description

Github action to get the latest release, prerelease or draft from another github repository.

This action is heavily inspired by https://github.com/marketplace/actions/get-latest-release witn some additional input and output fields. Token input was added to communicate with private repositories, and a few other fields were added that are a little more specific to my use case.
